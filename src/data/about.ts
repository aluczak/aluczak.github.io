  bio: `I am a senior software developer with over 18 years of experience in building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software solutions. Throughout my career, I've worked with various technologies and teams, always focusing on delivering high-quality code and solving complex problems.

My expertise lies in backend development with .NET and Azure, but I've also worked extensively with frontend technologies and DevOps practices. I thrive in remote environments and am comfortable working independently or as part of a distributed team.

I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the community.`,
